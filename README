What is MunkiAdmin?
-------------------

MunkiAdmin is a GUI for managing munki repositories. It is written
with Objective-C and uses in-memory Core Data store as a backend.

So what is munki and what are those munki repositories then? Well,
munki is a set of tools that allow administrators to define managed
installs for client machines. Repositories are served from a standard
web server.
