It is written\r\nwith Objective-C and uses in-memory Core Data store as a backend.\r\n\r\nSo what is munki and what are those munki repositories then? Well,\r\nmunki is a set of tools that allow administrators to define managed\r\ninstalls for client machines. Repositories are served from a standard\r\nweb server.\r\n\r\nFor more information, visit [Munki tools homepage](http://code.google.com/p/munki/)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Important:\r\n\r\nCode _is_ considered stable and it shouldn't have any major issues. However, MunkiAdmin is still alpha and not feature-complete so be prepared to see bugs. If you decide to run this on a production repo, make sure your backups are current or you have some other methods for going back in time. I'm using git version control on my munki repositories so I'll always know what was changed.\r\n\r\nYou can continue to use your favorite text editor to edit pkginfo files and manifests. MunkiAdmin is designed to complement your current workflow and it doesn't require any configuration or changes to your munki repository.\r\n\r\n\r\n# How to get MunkiAdmin?\r\n\r\n### Download a pre-built version:\r\n\r\nSee the [MunkiAdmin downloads page](https://github.com/hjuutilainen/munkiadmin/downloads) and [Release Notes wiki page](https://github.com/hjuutilainen/munkiadmin/wiki/Release-Notes)\r\n\r\n* Mac OS X 10.6 or later\r\n* munki tools installed in default location (/usr/local/munki/)\r\n\r\n### Build from source:\r\n\r\nClone, fork or download the source. Open MunkiAdmin.xcodeproj with Xcode and hit 'Run'. If you're making changes to the data model, you need to use mogenerator to keep NSManagedObject subclasses updated. So in short:\r\n\r\n* Xcode 4 or later\r\n* 10.7 or 10.8 SDK (comes with Xcode)\r\n* Optional: [mogenerator + Xmo'd](http://github.com/rentzsch/mogenerator)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Thanks to:\r\n\r\n* Jonathan Rentzsch for his [mogenerator](http://github.com/rentzsch/mogenerator)\r\n* CocoaDev [MultiPanePreferences](http://www.cocoadev.com/index.pl?MultiPanePreferences)\r\n* Cathy Shive for [NSCell example code](http://katidev.com/blog/2008/02/22/styling-an-nstableview-dttah/)\r\n* MunkiAdmin uses developer icons created by these wonderful people:\r\n    * [Glyphish Pro](http://www.glyphish.com)\r\n    * [Jonatan Castro Fern√°ndez](http://www.midtonedesign.com)\r\n    * Jonas Rask Design\r\n    * Matt Ball Design\r\n","google":"UA-30793877-1"}
